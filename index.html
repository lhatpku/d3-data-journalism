            <p class="show" id="age-impact">At the biological level, ageing results from the impact of the accumulation of a wide variety of molecular and cellular damage over time. 
              This leads to a gradual decrease in physical and mental capacity, a growing risk of disease, and ultimately, death. 
              But these changes are neither linear nor consistent, and they are only loosely associated with a personâ€™s age in years.</p>

            <p class="hide" id="poverty-impact">Health and poverty are inextricably intertwined. Being able to breast-feed, attend school, work to grow food, earn a living or feed a family all depend on a baseline level of good health.
                People enduring poverty are also usually less educated. They often have less knowledge about activities to promote health and when to access health care. 
                Poverty is also linked with Obesity, it has been suggested that individuals who live in impoverished regions have poor access to fresh food and, in addition, people living in poor areas are less active. 
            </p>

            <p class="hide" id="income-impact">Economic inequality is increasingly linked to disparities in life expectancy across the income distribution, and these disparities seem to be growing over time. 
                In a nearly stepwise fashion, low-income Americans have higher rates of physical limitation and of heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and other chronic conditions, compared to higher-income Americans. 
                Apart from that, lower income also means the lack of proper healthcare and health insurance coverage. </p>
